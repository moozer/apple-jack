# apple-jack
my first [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) game

This uses scratch 1.4, since that was the version that is in the debian repositories.

I tried to upload it to the scratch servers to be playable, but something went wrong in the conversion, so you must down scratch offline version 1.4 to test it.

1. Go [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch_1.4/) to download
2. clone it
3. open `farmer2.sb`
